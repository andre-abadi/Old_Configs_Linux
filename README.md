# My Arch Linux Configuration Files

Welcome to my personal set of configuration files for Arch Linux.

They probably work on most Linux flavours.

This isn't intended as a best-practice or even a good example, but it works for me.

This repository is just here for me to keep my best work in a way that can't be lost.

If you have an idea on how I can do better, let me know or fork this!

I have chosen to promote the GPL share-onwards principle, so if you make use of my files, please free yours too.

## Vimrc

This file is a cut-down version of that created by Amir Salihefendic.

The original can be found at [http://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.html](http://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.html)

Amir hasn't explicitly stated what license he has released his code under, so I'm making mine freely available like his.
